# Resume-Classification-and-Ranking-System-using-KNN-and-Cosine-Similarity

This project implements a system for classifying and ranking resumes based on their similarity to a given job description. Leveraging the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification and cosine similarity for ranking, it provides a comprehensive solution for matching candidates to job requirements efficiently.

Key Features:

Resume Classification: Automatically categorizes resumes into predefined classes or labels using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm based on similarities with job descriptions.

Ranking System: Ranks resumes according to their relevance to a particular job using cosine similarity, facilitating streamlined candidate selection processes.

KNN Algorithm: Utilizes the KNN algorithm to identify the most similar resumes to a given job description, enabling effective classification of candidates based on job requirements.

Cosine Similarity: Measures the similarity between resumes and job descriptions using cosine similarity, offering a scalable and accurate method for ranking candidates.
